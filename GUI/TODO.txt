FEATURES

Sync and repeat notes
    If notes are pressed when the user triggers a sync, the app sends note-off messages, then the SysEx, then note on messages matching what is still pressed

Load and save SysEx

Enhanced SysEx diff
    If two modified parameters are separated by a single unmodified parameter, it's more efficient to send a single SysEx with all three parameters than two separate SysEx messages.
    Where is the break-even point?

QUESTIONS

Can I do that LFO de-sync thing from the Youtube video? Or will sending SysEx reset the LFO?

Is bender range 24 two octaves up and down, or two octaves total?

Is there really no aftertouch, or can I enable it by writing to the addresses where it would be?

What are the PCM samples?



NOTES

Two address data types
    7-bit byte, 8-bit byte

class SysExMemory
    readSyx(filename)
        Reads a bunch of SysEx messages
        Each message is
            header
            address
            data
            end
        Computes checksum
    writeSyx(outFilename)
        Constructs a series of SysEx messages to write
        Computes checksum
    readMemory(filename)
        Reads a hex editor-style format
    writeMemory(outFilename)
        Writes a hex editor-style format
    mData
        Stored in 8-bit bytes
        Addresses can be empty

SysEx manager
    Collects SysEx changes and transmits them later, in a separate thread.
    When to send
        Manual -- wait for the user to push a button
        Note Release -- wait for all MIDI notes to be released
        Auto -- when notified of a parameter change, the SysEx is sent promptly (when the thread next runs). Afterwords, the thread will sleep (say 10ms).
    Maintains two SysExMemory objects
        The first is directly modified every time a parameter is changed
        The second reflects the current state of the device
        A temporary third is created from the first when the thread starts sending messages
    What to send
        Normally just the changes
        When instructed to, it sends the whole state
        As an advanced feature, it will fill gaps between changed parameters to reduce the number of messages
